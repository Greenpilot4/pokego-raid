This is a selfbot application that is used to join remote pokemon go raids faster than autoclickers. This was created as a ***proof of concept***, as a solution to autoclickers.  
## Features 
- Scrapes current bosses from [The Silph Road](https://thesilphroad.com/raid-bosses)
- Saves token to `token.json`
- Faster than autoclickers :D
## Usage 
- Download python 3.6 + 
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running Exe
If you are on windows and have no idea what you are doing, it is probably best to run the EXE from the "release" tab on the right. Download the latest release and enjoy.
